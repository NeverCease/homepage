      <p>Ideas Never Cease (!NC) is a holding company for <em>whatever</em> comes into the mind of Paul Anthony Webb. It is relatively simple to start a business and this is something many people want to do. However, we want to <em>change the world</em> as well. Here are some (probably crazy) ideas we intend to pursue or are currently pursuing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The only social network you'll ever need</li>
        <li>Open-source operating system</li>
        <li>A.I. companions</li>
        <li>Hoverboard (yes, seriously)</li>
        <li>...and more stuff on our <a href="/projects" title="The projects !NC is currently working on">Projects</a> page</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </main>
