  <p><strong>Ideas Never Cease</strong>, a company name and a universal truth. Ideas encompass our lives and everything we do. Why think "outside of the box" when you can <strong>think outside of the sphere</strong> that contains this box? Our mission is simple: to <strong>delight</strong>, <strong>inform</strong>, and <strong>change the world</strong>. And then, <strong>other worlds</strong>. üòÅ</p>
