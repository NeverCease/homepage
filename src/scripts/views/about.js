      <p>Ideas Never Cease (!NC) is a one-man shop for all things neat and Internet. Run by Paul Anthony Webb, it began as a company to house his ideas. It remains as such but [REDACTED] things are happening...</p>

      <p>Paul taught himself to code in the recession of '08. Despite existing before the advent of the Web(b), he soon began to live up to his namesake while dabbling in music and fashion. A designer/coder hybrid, he is uniquely equipped to both see the future and build it.</p>

      <p>Here are some (probably crazy) ideas we intend to pursue or are currently pursuing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The only social network you'll ever need</li>
        <li>Open-source operating system</li>
        <li>A.I. companions</li>
        <li>Hoverboard <del>(yes, seriously)</del> (need more research)</li>
        <li>...and more stuff on our <a href="/projects" title="The projects !NC is currently working on">Projects</a> page</li>
      </ul>
